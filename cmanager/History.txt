                             CManager History

    1.8     18/02/00    - Fixed Thor import, screwed in the previous

                        - Thor importer splits name/last name parts.
                        - Fixed CM crash when quitting it while an edit
                          window is open.
                        - Added MUIM_CManager_Cleanup: application
                          *MUST* call this method before disposing the

                          to load during MUIM_Setup. This has been broken
                          in one of the previous releases, causing some
                          out-of-synch troubles.

                          to the calling CM.mcc object.
                        - The .mcc didn't reload the prefs when clicking

                          don't have separate first/last name fields
                          (like YAM) CM will split the name at the
                          last blank.

                          when there is no logged in user, but will use
