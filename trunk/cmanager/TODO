                        Contact Manager Suggestions
                        ---------------------------

                                   USERS

A way to store a small image would be cool. This would mean we can store
pictures of people in the Contact Manager. Borrow V's image decoding
routines, and scale all images down to a certain size that we all like (any
ideas? I'd say about 75x75) for display.


   Communications Tracker
   ----------------------
   Every time something is added to the Comments field, it should put
   something like this: [ADDED <date> <time> by <user>]. Eventually,
   the Comms Tracker ends up with something like this:

       [ADDED 21-Jan-1998, 3:05pm by JASON]
       Called at 4pm
       [ADDED 6-Feb-1998, 2:18pm by JASON]
       Arranged to meet at 5pm on Tuesday.

   This is of course, much more effective if TextInput would allow
   inverse text and different colours, which is something TI really
   does need (IMHO).

   This idea stems from using Tracker Contact Manager at work. It's
   *incredibly* useful. People can use their Amigsa to keep track of
   time spent on the phone to clients, etc. This would be a big
   advantage of using Contact Manager, and shouldn't be THAT hard to
   implement (surely, as its just a big text area, though the TI
   modificaitons would be needed for it to be properly realised).
